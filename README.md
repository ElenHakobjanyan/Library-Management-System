# Library-Management-System
"Library" management system was created. The system provides two modes of using the program: as a user or as an administrator. 
The user's capabilities include having access to the list of books, applying filters to the provided list by specifying the parameters of the book being searched by, having the ability to reserve a book, and being able to track the dates and history of the books they taken. 
The admin is allowed to make changes both in the list of books of the library and in the list of users, unlike a regular user, the admin can see the list of books taken by all users, but, in turn, he can not reserve books.
Viewing the list of books and the list of users, making changes in them, as well as operations with the user account are performed by referring to the corresponding tables in the database.
The software implementation was given using the C++ programming language, in the Qt graphical environment.
